assignment 1 comp20 repository
Name: John Kerns, utln: jkerns01
1. I believe everything has been implemented correctly. The validator approves of all my html pages and css, all pages are stored on the master branch of my github.io repository, my css has at least five rules, index.html, resume.html, and bio.html all are names and implemented properly. 
2. No collaboration on this assignment, would like to change that for future work in this course.
3. I would say this assignment took me approximately 6-8 hours. The actual coding was not difficult, rather the time consuming part for me was searching google for specific syntax quirks as well as working out how to consistently use github.
