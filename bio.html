	<h1>Doug Lipstick: Doug Lipstick</h1>
	<h2>Biography</h2>
	
	<p>From the moment this adorable infant first grasped his mothers long squiggly wet fingers so many years ago, Doug Lipstick has always been fascinated by eels. From young eel-firehose firefighter to surrogate whisperer of bad news, Lipstick is truly the R'eel D'eel. Doug Lipstick embodies the values and skills of a bonified Eel Master. His magnum opus, Doug Lipstick's All-Eel Zoo is an amazing place. With lots of eels, and no other animals. Eels only. Just the way Doug likes it.</p>
